Raging Octopous is our devweek 2017 hackathon submission.

It is a Flock OS app integrated directly into the Flock web client. Once installed you can easily create and manage calendar events by just simply typing out a message, no need to change tabs, open another app, etc. 

Check it, including the API server, out at [raging octopus](https://github.com/ragingoctopus)!
